My Steps
1. Install Git
2. Clone repository (downloads files to local repository, doesn't make new repository or fork)
3. Git push (did you mean git pull?) 
downloading current version off github repository to your local one 
5. Make changes
6. git commit -a -m "Message for file changes"
 the -a is to commit all files, -m for message
6. Git push 
Okay for some reason this uploads changes and comits them
Git pull Merges all the files
7. Repeat 3-6 every time you do something
*Whenever there is a bug do what it tells you do or look it up
git bash is a thing
